# GEN-X Testnet Explorer

The GEN-X Testnet explorer is the best place to see the data economy happening. Asset publishing and consumptions can be observed live as on-chain activity. This enables a full audit trail of all asset offerings and consumptions. The explorer is a fork of the open source project BlockScout (https://docs.blockscout.com/).
