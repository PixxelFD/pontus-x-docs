## Meeting Notes

### Agenda
- GEN-X Consensus Issue from 08.05.23
- Block Sealing Presentation
- Validator Communication via Slack and Email
- Polygon Edge Client v0.9.0: Asking for a presentation from the Supernets Team

### Decisions
- Invite all members to Slack via Email to the GEN-X channel
- Emergencies should be communicated via Email and Slack
- Ask the Polygon Supernets team for a presentation
- Let's wait for further releases before switching to a new client

### Notes
- GEN-X is using the client v0.6.2 - this client has assumeably a bug which caused a consensus halt at block 6644379
- We had to do a hard fork from an earlier block (6620000) using a backup here from the daily bootnode backups
- Bootnodes had to block validators that were not using this earlier backup as Nakamoto Consensus would force them to use the longest chain, which could not find consensus 
- This also affected the block explorer, which showed outdated values until the old block height (6644379) was overpassed
- The network is stable now and validators should double-check their nodes to see if they are still connected to the network
- Bootnodes use an IP allowList now - so only allowed IPs can connect to bootnodes

- Release details for v0.9.0: https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge/releases/tag/v0.9.0

### Open ItemsÂ 
- Invite more members to Slack via Email
- Ask Supernet team for a presentation
